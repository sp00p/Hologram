# Hologram

Hologram is a simple plugin to create holograms using armor stands in Spigot servers.  


## Getting Started

If you want to edit the code simple install the repo as a ZIP file, otherwise check releases for the latest build!

### Prerequisites

You're going to want to have Minecraft Java Edition and an IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ.

### Installing

Unzip the zip file after you install it into a folder. After that go into an IDE of your choice and find the HologramPlugin.java file. That's the file that does all the work. 

### Usage 

The command syntax is as follows:
```
/hologram create cc <msg> y <yPos>
``` 

Supported colors and formatting options can be found here:
